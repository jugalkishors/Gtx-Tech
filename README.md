# Tenants Task

Let's build something. This is a test project. Please read the instructions carefully. A company that manages lots of properties need a web application were they can manage the tenants. You need to build a small web application using React. We will review the code and based on that you will be shortlisted for interview round. Create a new application in react that helps manage tenants residing in different properties. 1. The application should display a list of real-estate properties. 2. It should be possible to see details of a property. 3. It should be possible to display/add/edit/remove tenants from the property. - No interactions with backend are needed, you can mock the data. - Styling isn't important. You can use MaterialUI / Bootstarp / SemanticUI / Fluent or any other component library.- Please make sure to write clean/good quality code. Paste the github link below. If the code is found to be copied then that will immediately disqualify you.
